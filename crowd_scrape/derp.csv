Food,{$20;$50;$150;},"""29""","{At Trevin Farms we believe in knowing where your food comes from.  We raise our dairy goats from kids, most born right here on the farm, milk them and create our wonderful cheese from their milk.  There is nothing like fresh goat's milk cheese (Chevre).  The owners of Trevin Farms were chefs from the Boston area who moved to Vermont to get away from the big city.  We built our farm and our goat herd from the scratch.  We created our farm stay business in hopes that we will introduce life on the farm to our guests.  We have had people from around the world stay with us on our 40 acre farm in Vermont.  The one question they have all asked is ""where can we buy your cheese""?  We unfortunately have to tell them that we can not sell our cheese to the public due to government regulations.  We are working very hard toward that dream.  We need to purchase the cheese making equipment and renovate our garage into a cheese making facility.   We decided to ask for donations because of all the red tape when it comes to applying for grants or funding.  We are working very hard to be able to sell our farmstead cheese to the public but have hit brick walls time after time. Nothing would make us prouder than to be able to make available to the public, our farmstead goat cheese. We have offered some great rewards to ""thank you"" for your donations. We are very passionate about our goats, farm, farm stay and cheese.}",2012-02-28T19:54:37-05:00,{},[0],0,{},"$67,000",0,3235.0,"Sudbury, VT",3,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1118244872/farmstead-cheese-making-operation-at-trevin-farms/,[2],"{Frequently Asked Questions

Confused, relieved, angry and unfulfilled the two followers question each other’s motives for joining, living & surviving under the control of their Leader. Faced with their own doubts, Bennett and Marissa must confront their feelings and fears while deciding what life to live after (near) death.PRE-PRODUCTION:  has already started. We are budgeted and scheduled. As we get closer to meeting our financial goal we will start to book and commit to the elements necessary to make this film (ie. Equipment, Locations, etc.)PRODUCTION: We will require three shoot days for this project. The script is twelve pages and we feel like a three day shoot will be more than enough to accomplish what is needed.  And pending any unforeseen conflicts we will shoot the week of January 28, 2013.POST PRODUCTION: Will start immediately after production and is estimated to take us through the end of March 2013. We intend the final product to be approximately 10mins in run time.TECHNICAL MUMBO-JUMBO: For those of you interested in what we will be shooting on and with here is a little peak behind the curtain to see some of the camera gear we intend to use:You might be wondering why we're trying to raise $50,000. Well, the short answer is; films are expensive. There is so much that goes into making a film— the non-glamorous, often unknown aspects that makes what we watch believable and real. When making a film, of any length, you are creating a world. When you see an image from a film or television show, understand that everything you see (and don't see) has been planned and arranged with a purpose. From the location that was chosen or the set that was built, to the set dressing and decoration that fills the space, to the props the actors interact with and the costumes they wear; everything has been bought, rented or made. It takes very skilled and talented individuals to accomplish these tasks. On top of everything you see there are the lights and camera equipment, and their technicians, which also require incredible expertise to execute.Once you've got your crew, actors, equipment, location, food, logistics (parking etc.), and insurance; it all adds up. Everyone involved in this project is a professional and we are aiming to raise enough money to make a professional film.The creative forces [bio’s below] behind this project are all donating their time, effort and skill to the project but that still isn’t enough to pull it all together. If all of you -- friends, family, and fans --donate what you can (even if it's just a little) we will easily attain our funding goal!  We are so lucky to have assembled the team we have. Troian, Shay & Nolan have been amazing supporters of our work and have agreed to be a part of this project because they believe in us & the script. We hope you will too. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us.Hazart (writer/directors)(twitter: @hasday, instagram: @stillhazart) Website | TumblrHazart is the combined efforts of Kyle Hasday and Matt Stewart.

Both are graduates of Chapman University’s School of Film and Television. Working in feature, commercial, music video and television production, Hazart has gained extensive professional experience in physical production, development and the creative tasks of bringing a script to life.Troian Bellisario (actor 'BENNETT')(twitter: @sleepinthegardn, instagram: @sleepinthegardn) TumblrTroian Bellisario is an accomplished television, theater and film actress in addition to a talented writer and producer. Fated to be a filmmaker, Troian has grown up on sets her entire life and began her on-screen career at the tender age of three. Before attending USC's Drama School, Troian was already an experienced television actress and soon began to star in theater productions and independent films. Currently, Troian stars in the hit ABC Family series, 'Pretty Little Liars' playing the role of Spencer Hastings.Shay Mitchell (actor 'MARISSA')(twitter: @shaymitch, instagram: @shaym) WebsiteShay Mitchell is an actress and philanthropist best known for her role of Emily Fields on the ABC Family show 'Pretty Little Liars'. Shay found her way in front of a camera at an early age. She quickly was discovered by an international modeling agency in Vancouver and traveled around the globe including stops in Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Barcelona. After landing roles in commercials and Canadian television series, Shay moved to Los Angeles to work on 'Pretty Little Liars.'Nolan North (actor 'LEADER')(twitter: @nolan_north)Nolan North has been described as “the nearest thing the games industry has to a bona fide leading man.”  As an immensely talented and highly respected actor and voice actor, Nolan has had continued success in television and video games and is beginning to break into feature films. While he is best known for his portrayals of the lead character’s in popular games such as ‘Uncharted’, ‘Prince of Persia’ and ‘Assassin’s Creed’, he is also very accomplished on screen as well, appearing shows such as ‘Big Love’, ‘Ugly Betty’, and ‘NCIS’. Nolan currently plays the role of Peter Hastings on the ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars and is due to appear in J.J.

Since the birth of their company the two have had successful endeavors to include a Fiat web-campaign, an award winning travel show, multiple short films, and a feature documentary screened across the country. The girls are committed to developing uniquely original content regardless of the genre, medium, or budget. They foster the creation of “NE” story that deserves to be told. That being said – the partnership with Hazart is an exciting and fulfilling venture as they delve into “Immediately Afterlife”.Brandon Alperin (cinematographer)(twitter: @gipperpl, instagram: @gipperpl) WebsitePicking up a 35mm camera at a young age, Brandon was enamored by how some emulsion, chemicals and photo paper in a dark room could shed so much light on life.  Learning from and inspired by acclaimed photographers and cinematographers, Brandon has sought to create the idea of nostalgia and macabre through moving images. Graduating from Chapman University’s School of Film and Television, with an emphasis in Cinematography, Brandon entered the professional world of filmmaking and has lit for some of the most sought after cinematographers in music videos, commercials and features. He has taken his knowledge and expertise on journeys around the world: from time-lapse on the steps of the temples of Tikal in Guatemala, to an intimate one on one with the Dalai Lama in India. Brandon is in constant search of the next great image with which to tell a story.We've got some great prizes for you to check out as a reward for donating virtually any amount of money.

We are relying on so many people and elements coming together for three days to make this project happen. And all of the prizes/rewards require a big group of talented and busy people to work in unison on a very concise schedule to make this film happen. That said that we are supremely confident in our and our team’s ability to pull this all together in a timely manor.The photo prizes (including poster) will be shot during the week of production (end of January). We will then need time to process, edit and print the photos and posters before they can be mailed (via ground shipping). We estimate that these prizes will be completed 1 month after principle photography is completed. If we are able to hold to our late January schedule that would put the photos and posters to be completed at the beginning of March and delivery in middle of that month. These dates are scheduled to change due to a variety of circumstances such as, later dates for principle photography, longer editing of photos or printing delays. The other delay to keep in mind that all of the signed merchandise is dependant on Shay and Troian’s availability to sit down and autograph everything, while we are sure they will do it in a timely manor we must also respect their other obligations. The only thing we can guarantee is that you will get your prize and we will be diligent and thorough in our work.DVD prizes will be a later reward due to our need to complete the film as well as restrict its availability so that we may submit the film to festivals. The DVD's should ship in September (giving us time to submit to festivals) but could be later due to conflicts unforeseen that push the principle photography of the film from late January.We thank you again for your support.}",2013-01-08T15:00:00-05:00,{},[49],0,"{Bonjour :) It would be possible to have subtitles in French pleeeeeeaaaaase?

However, your support is still needed in order to make this project into a commercially viable full-length CD.  See Updates (in the upper left hand section of this page) for details!................................................................................................................This CD project is part of my Doctoral project in Jazz Composition. It will be comprised of 6 arrangements – some for big band – some for jazz orchestra – EVERY arrangement featuring an amazing jazz singer. Kate Reid (http://www.katereidmusic.com/), Peter Eldridge (http://www.petereldridge.com/) Lauren Kinhan (http://laurenkinhan.com), Anders Edenröth from The Real Group (http://www.RealGroup.se), Kevin Mahogany (www.kevinmahogany.com/) and Kate McGarry (http://www.katemcgarry.com) are signed on for the project.  (For more info regarding the specifics of each singer and the arrangements they will sing, click on ""Updates"" at the top of the page!)In addition to the challenges that go along with writing and recording a custom-arrangement for each and every singer on the project, the project is also financially challenging. It is difficult for an independent composer/arranger to produce a high-quality vocal album with a live big band and studio jazz orchestra. The funds raised will largely go toward defraying production costs, as well as toward helping me to treat well (buy lunch/dinner, etc...) the upwards of 50 musicians involved in this project. Any remaining funds will go toward mastering the project. My mission in life is to connect with individuals – it is what makes me passionate and brings me the greatest joy. I feel fortunate to have been able to connect with people through music. If you are reading this, and considering donating to this project, please know how grateful I am for the role you have had in my journey. You have likely made more of an impact on me than you know. Thank you!It is possible (though unlikely) that a given track may have a licensing issue.
Beyond that, I am working with each professional singer to ensure that they are happy with the arrangement written for them: that it fits them to a tee, and that they are happy with the recorded instrumental tracks and vocals. However, it will ultimately be their decision whether the final cut may be distributed to the general public. Worst case scenario, I would have a ""scratch"" (though perfectly wonderful) vocalist sing a given cut, so the Kickstarter contributor might still hear the arrangement.}",2013-01-21T18:00:09-05:00,{},[1],0,"{Hi Jeremy!
